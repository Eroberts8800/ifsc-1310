                    SpaceX began developing the Dragon spacecraft in late 2004, making a public announcement in 2006
                    with a plan of entering service in 2009. Also in 2006, SpaceX won a contract to use the Dragon
                    spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the International Space Station for the
                    American federal space agency, NASA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and
                    operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit. On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of
                    Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the
                    International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX is contracted to deliver cargo to the ISS under NASA's
                    Commercial Resupply Services program, and Dragon began regular cargo flights in October 2012. With
                    the Dragon spacecraft and the Orbital ATK Cygnus, NASA seeks to increase its partnerships with
                    domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry. On 3 June 2017, the CRS-11 capsule largely
                    assembled from previously flown components from the CRS-4 mission in September 2014 was launched
                    again for the first time, with the hull, structural elements, thrusters, harnesses, propellant
                    tanks, plumbing and many of the avionics reused while the heat shield, batteries and components
                    exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.
