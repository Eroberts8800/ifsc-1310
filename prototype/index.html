        <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
        <p>
          Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of
          NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before
          him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took
          off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though
          he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments
          indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists
          monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side
          effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing
          of his pulse.
        </p>
        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic
          Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had
          ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310
          miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South
          Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

            Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up
            to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man
            up to do a monkey's work."<strong

        <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>
        <p>
          The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally
          developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11
          Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the
          USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United
          States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.

         <h2>The Journey</h2>
         <p>
            Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. 
            The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, 
            considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.
