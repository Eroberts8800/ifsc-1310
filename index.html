  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  <p>Web accessibility in my opinion, means any tool, software, or service built into a web application 
    that makes the web application accessible and easier to use. This means that no matter what physical or 
    mental ailment a person may be suffering from, web accessibility features can help make a web application 
    usable and accessible to the people who need those features to properly use and navigate the application. 
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important in the landscape of the web to take a moment and consider that just because you personally 
  can navigate and understand a web application, that not everyone has that ability. For example  if there were a
  person that was partially sighted or colorblind, and they went onto a web application that had low color contrast 
  or small text, then that person may be unable to read anything that is on the screen. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Web accessibility goes beyond just what is displayed on a web application. For instance, let’s consider limitations 
  that a user might have on the hardware side of the spectrum. If a user is unable to use his hands say from a freak accident 
  or a genetic disease, using a mouse to navigate a web application may be challenging or impossible. In this case something like 
  a screen reader or an alternative voice command system to navigate the page would be an excellent accessibility feature to have 
  implemented into an application.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main takeaway on discussions of web accessibility and why it is so important is that the end user is the goal. When you develop 
  something you want the person who uses it to be able to use it properly and enjoy their experience with it. A web developer could create 
  the greatest website in existence and have it look amazing, but if the user that wants to access it can’t properly use it then that user 
  now effectively has a pretty image on their screen that they cannot use and they will leave. If that user then goes and tells friends, colleagues, 
  coworkers, or a random person on the street about their negative experience, the traffic, usage, and reputation of the site will suffer as a result.
 </p>
 <h2>Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
 <p>
  Progressive enhancement is a method of web development that puts the content of the site as the top priority. It is used to make sure that no matter what medium the website is displayed on, the content is intact and remains usable and accessible for the user who is interacting with it. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because while it is nice to try and utilize new features and stay at the cutting edge of the web and web development, you need to consider the fact that not everyone is going to be able to utilize and understand these new features and developments that are made on the web. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if a browser has the newest and greatest features that can be used on a website, the top priority is still the content of the site. It’s the reason people visit the site in the first place and if the content suffers or is lackluster in the interest of trying to implement new tools and features, then even if the site looks amazing it will suffer as a whole and not be able to accomplish its primary purpose of utilizing the content that it was made for.
