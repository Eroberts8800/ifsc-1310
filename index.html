  <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
  <p>Web accessibility in my opinion, means any tool, software, or service built into a web application 
    that makes the web application accessible and easier to use. This means that no matter what physical or 
    mental ailment a person may be suffering from, web accessibility features can help make a web application 
    usable and accessible to the people who need those features to properly use and navigate the application. 
 </p>
 <p>
  It is important in the landscape of the web to take a moment and consider that just because you personally 
  can navigate and understand a web application, that not everyone has that ability. For example  if there were a
  person that was partially sighted or colorblind, and they went onto a web application that had low color contrast 
  or small text, then that person may be unable to read anything that is on the screen. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Web accessibility goes beyond just what is displayed on a web application. For instance, let’s consider limitations 
  that a user might have on the hardware side of the spectrum. If a user is unable to use his hands say from a freak accident 
  or a genetic disease, using a mouse to navigate a web application may be challenging or impossible. In this case something like 
  a screen reader or an alternative voice command system to navigate the page would be an excellent accessibility feature to have 
  implemented into an application.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main takeaway on discussions of web accessibility and why it is so important is that the end user is the goal. When you develop 
  something you want the person who uses it to be able to use it properly and enjoy their experience with it. A web developer could create 
  the greatest website in existence and have it look amazing, but if the user that wants to access it can’t properly use it then that user 
  now effectively has a pretty image on their screen that they cannot use and they will leave. If that user then goes and tells friends, colleagues, 
  coworkers, or a random person on the street about their negative experience, the traffic, usage, and reputation of the site will suffer as a result.
 </p>
 <h2>Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h2>
 <p>
  Progressive enhancement is a method of web development that puts the content of the site as the top priority. It is used to make sure that no matter what medium the website is displayed on, the content is intact and remains usable and accessible for the user who is interacting with it. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because while it is nice to try and utilize new features and stay at the cutting edge of the web and web development, you need to consider the fact that not everyone is going to be able to utilize and understand these new features and developments that are made on the web. 
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if a browser has the newest and greatest features that can be used on a website, the top priority is still the content of the site. It’s the reason people visit the site in the first place and if the content suffers or is lackluster in the interest of trying to implement new tools and features, then even if the site looks amazing it will suffer as a whole and not be able to accomplish its primary purpose of utilizing the content that it was made for.
 </p>
 <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection </h2>
 <p>
  When I began Web Technologies, I had a very loose understanding of HTML, but despite that, I thought I had a fairly good understanding of web architecture and what made a good website. As I began learning the mechanics and languages that created a website and what went into it my perspective changed a great deal. I previously had no idea that CSS was even a thing, or how JavaScript could be utilized to add functionality to an application. To a certain extent I believed through my basic understanding of HTML, that it wouldn’t be overly complicated to create something, I can without a doubt say now, that was a false perspective on my part.
 </p>
 <p>
  As time went on and I attended lectures, steadily learning new elements and tools that were needed to create web applications, it steadily occurred to me that all of these elements would compound with each other to create something. In individual pieces, it didn’t seem too complicated at a surface level to make these elements work. But then when I reflected on the concept of web accessibility, something clicked for me in my understanding. 
 </p>
 <p>
  The “click” moment for better or worse really occurred when I began my first draft of the Dragon project. I had outlined my HTML and felt that I was on a good pace for completion of the website. Then I began styling it with CSS and I had a massive slowdown, because I began to see the live server results and how my styling really appeared as an actual website people would use. What followed was roughly 20 hours of tweaking my layout and designs, only to realize that every time I would make a change, I would imagine how it looked from an outside perspective and realize there was something confusing, unattractive, distracting, or just plain wrong with what I had done. I was in a mindset of asking myself, does this make sense to someone who would go in with no prior context of the content.
 </p>
 <p>
  I felt enabled in the fact that I actually understood the majority of what I was coding, and I thankfully stayed mostly structured and maintained a mostly steady workflow throughout the project. Another thing I learned at the same time is how discouraging it can be when you put hours into fixing a problem or trying to perfect a design layout, only to realize when your almost complete with it that you suddenly realized a better way. So then for the sake of accessibility and trying to create the best project you can, you cut a large portion in the pursuit of something that will be better for a user. My only regret is that I would fix if I had to start all over is to make a more complete design layout prior to beginning and save myself some of the back and forth of doing something only to realize that I could do it better, and having to go back.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I got feedback from my mom who has a notoriously difficult time with technology, it was extremely constructive. I realized exactly how sensitive an outside perspective is to things like margin differences, and font sizes. While this can vary from person to person, it helped me consider that elements that may seem insignificant can have a very big impact on  your site being easy to follow and not distracting a user from the content. So taking that info I modified some margins and spacing and tweaked some font sizes to make sure that the website would flow through the content with as little kinks or distractions as possible.
 </p>
 <p>
  This semester while going through this class, I knew there would be a lot of technical code and the actual structure elements of a website. What I did not expect was for things such as graphic design and opening my perspective to focus on the end user to be a focus, but I now have a much greater appreciation for these factors. This Dragon project especially helped me understand and appreciate the actual process of creating something like this and how many factors and elements have to work together in order to make something that is actually effective and useable to an actual audience and end user.
